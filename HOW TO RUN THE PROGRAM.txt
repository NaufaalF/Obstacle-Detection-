=== GETTING STARTED ===
Please note that this project already includes a pre-trained model. You have two options:

1. Run the program immediately using the existing model.
2. Train a new model by following a few additional steps.

If you choose to train your own model, please complete the "TRAIN THE MODEL" section first, then proceed to "RUN THE MAIN PROGRAM".

=== TRAIN THE MODEL ===

!!! HARDWARE RECOMMENDATION !!!
For the training process, we strongly recommend using a device with a high-end graphics card (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce series).
Disclaimer: These training steps have only been tested on an NVIDIA RTX 3050. Compatibility and performance on other graphics cards are not guaranteed.

1. Navigate to the "data" folder in the project directory.
2. Read and follow the instructions in the "DATA INSTRUCTIONS.txt" file.
3. Once completed, open and run the "Training.ipynb" notebook.
4. In the notebook, edit all necessary parameters (e.g., directory names, sources, destinations).
5. Run all cells in the notebook.
	Note: This process can take a significant amount of time, depending on your dataset size and configuration.
6. When finished, a new model file will be created and saved in the "runs" directory.
7. The model will be named "best.pt" by default, or the custom name you specified.
8. Your custom model is now ready to use!

=== RUN THE MAIN PROGRAM ===
1. Run the "app.py" script.
2. Open the script and edit all necessary parameters, such as directory paths and the model's location ("best.pt" or your custom model).
3. Execute the file in your terminal (e.g., using a "Run Python File in Terminal" command or by typing python app.py).
4. The terminal will display output similar to this:
	* Serving Flask app 'app'
 	* Debug mode: off
	WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 	* Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 	* Running on http://127.x.x.x:xxxx
 	* Running on http://192.xxx.x.xxx:xxxx
5. Copy one of the http links and paste it into your web browser.
6. http://127.x.x.x:xxxx is for local access on your current device only.
7. http://192.xxx.x.xxx:xxxx is for accessing the app from other devices on the same Wi-Fi network.
8. The application should now be running in your browser.

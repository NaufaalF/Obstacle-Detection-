If you want to add some dataset to train, try find some dataset that include:
- Train
- Test
- Valid
- data.yaml

For an example you can download some dataset from website named Roboflow like the link below 
It's available to download for free. It's also the dataset we used in this project.
You can check the whole dataset on our roboflow project:
https://universe.roboflow.com/models/object-detection

After download the dataset, extract the compressed dataset and then move everything inside to this directory

Remember, these steps was unnecessary if you just want to run the program immediately.
These additional steps were only made to those who want to know about the process of making a Machine Learning model.

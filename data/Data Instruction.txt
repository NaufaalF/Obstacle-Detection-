If you want to add some dataset to train, try find some dataset that include:
- Train
- Test
- Valid
- data.yaml

For an example you can download some dataset from website named Roboflow like the link shortcut in this directory
It's avalaible to download for free. It's also the dataset we used in this project

After download the dataset, extract the compressed dataset and then move everything inside to this directory

Remember, these steps was unecessarry if you just want to run the program immediately.
These additional steps were only made to those who want to know about the process of making a Machine Learning model.
